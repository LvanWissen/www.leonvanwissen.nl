abstract: "In this paper, the full pipeline from archives to annotations is represented that comprehends the successive stages of scanning, indexing, transcribing, correcting, aggregating, and modelling the entities of archival documents into RDF as Linked Open Data. It provides the creation of transparent datasets that can be replicated, evaluated and used for quantitative analyses in digital humanities research."
